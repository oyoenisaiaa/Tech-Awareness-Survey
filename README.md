# Tech-Awareness-Survey
A tech awareness survey highlighting essential skills, challenges, motivations, and barriers in the field. Inspired by Group 5 from Africa Agility Foundationâ€™s MentorHer Program 3.0, this project aimed to uncover knowledge gaps and insights, helping us better understand and support diverse community needs in tech.

This repository includes an infographic summary of the tech awareness survey and a report on our group's virtual community project. The event addressed tech challenges, broke down entry barriers, dispelled common myths, and promoted accessible tech education through Africa Agility Foundation, empowering participants to pursue tech careers regardless of their background or experience.
